# Future Features

Creating an avatar that you can equip with gear and weapons is a feature I would love to add to this app, but that requires artistic skills which I currently lack. The same applies to customizable themes for the app. Both features could serve as additional incentives to level up and complete achievements, but hiring someone for these tasks is something I'm still considering.

# Currently Not planned

Online functionality, such as profile creation, leaderboards, and a friends list system, is not planned as it would require maintaining a server, which I do not have the time, nerves, or money for.
